# SNHU-CS210-Project3
Project 3 this is for the Portfolio submission

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 is asking to build code that can read and write data to files, interact with user input, and integrate Python and C++ together.

# What did you do particularly well?
In this I was able to seemlesly integrate the strengths of Python and C++.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I noticed a few places that the code could be enhanced. I chose not to implement them due to the requirements of the project. I believe that a much more user friendly user interface would have made this a better project. This could have made user input validation more efficent by only allowing correct answers to be giving, such as buttons for intended input. I.E. button 1, 2, or 3. Also the visualizations could have been improved over a text based histogram using matplotlib or altair in Python. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The text based histogram actually proved rather difficult to create. This was not because it was difficult to code but rather to conceptualize. I am using stackoverflow to help with coding problems and geeksforgeeks and many other helpful resources to help understand the questions asked of me.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills of interweaving multiple languages will definitely help me in future projects and course work. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I leave comments littering my code so I can come back and know exactly what I was doing where. This includes comments on function creation, variables, loops, catches, and pretty much anything else that isn't self explanitory. I sometimes write code knowing I will later create a function and just comment #TODO, this allows me to finish my traing of thought. I always use variable instead of literal values which makes my code adaptable.
